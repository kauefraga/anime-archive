> I used to write the animes that i watch right in a plain text file. Therefore, i created Anime Archive to facilitate the process of opening file explorer, searching for the file where i used to write those animes that i watched, write a anime with its url and maybe upload it to Google Drive, just for backup. I decided to use Golang because it's a fast, compiled and a reliable programming language with garbage collector, concurrency and a robust built-in library. See my Python attempt of it, [anime-list](https://github.com/kauefraga/anime-list-python).

### Features

- A fancy UI that is easy to use.
- Everything looks better with some colors, and i am addicted to it.
- If you forgot how to use it, just ask for help: `anime-archive --help`.

## ‚¨áÔ∏è How to install and use it

The application with all basic features that i want isn't ready for release. I will build and release as soon as possible, don't worry.

## ü¶Ñ Technical Stuff

If you want to learn more about the project and maybe help me to improve it, see the [ONBOARDING](ONBOARDING.md).

## üìã To Do List

- Develop all the CRUD operations, as i transcribed: `catalog` (read), `store` (create), `find` (read), `remove` (delete)...
- Think about a online database, like a Postgres instance at [Render](https://render.com), a MySQL at [Planet Scale](https://planetscale.com) or a simpler solution like [Atlas MongoDb](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas).
